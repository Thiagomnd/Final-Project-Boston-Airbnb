# Boston Airbnb Listings - Investment Recommendation for Real Estate Acquisition in the city of Boston - Massachusetts - US

The investor believes that acquiring real estate in this region can be an intelligent way to diversify his assets.

At the end of this project, valuable insights will be provided that will guide our client's real estate investment decisions.

Initially, 3 datasets were used for this analysis, having been taken from the Inside Airbnb website.

During the analysis, 2 more datasets were added, which are updates of the "listings.csv" dataset. During the project we will explain the reason for these updates.

1 - listings.csv: list of all properties in the period between 11/11/2008 and 09/06/2016 with 96 variables (columns) and 3,885 records (rows).

2 - calendar.csv: list of prices and availability of properties in the period between 09/06/2016 and 09/05/2017 with 6 variables (columns) and 68,275 records (rows).

3 - reviews.csv: list of reviews that users made about the experiences they had at the properties in the period between 03/21/2009 and 09/06/2016 with 4 variables (columns) and 1,308,890 records (rows).

4 - listings_atualizado.xlsx: updated list of all properties after “data cleaning” in the period between 12/03/2008 and 08/21/2016 with 96 variables (columns) and 1,343 records (rows).

5 - listings_43properties.xlsx: list updated after “data cleaning” with the 43 most profitable Airbnb properties in the period between 03/19/2010 and 03/28/2016 with 96 variables (columns) and 43 records (rows).
